# Autism Adolescent Data plus Description

This project focuses on enhancing the early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. Given the significant healthcare costs and the rising number of ASD cases worldwide, the need for time-efficient and accessible screening methods is critical. This project proposes a dataset and applies various supervised machine learning models to improve the classification accuracy of ASD cases.

* Develop a dataset with 20 features for autism screening in adults, including 10 behavioral traits (AQ-10-Adolescent) and 10 individual characteristics.
* Apply and compare multiple machine learning classifiers to enhance screening accuracy
* Identify the most effective model or combination of models (ensemble learning) for classifying ASD cases.
